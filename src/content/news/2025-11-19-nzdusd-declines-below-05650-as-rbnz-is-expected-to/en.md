The NZD/USD pair is trending downwards, currently hovering around 0.5645 during the early Asian session on Wednesday. The New Zealand Dollar is coming under pressure as traders brace for what is anticipated to be the final 25 basis points rate cut by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ). This move is expected to further weaken the NZD against the stronger US Dollar.

Market participants will be closely monitoring the upcoming FOMC Minutes later today, which could provide insights into the Federal Reserve's monetary policy direction. As the exchange rate continues to fluctuate, the implications of the RBNZ's decision and potential signals from the Fed could lead to increased volatility in the NZD/USD currency pair in the near term.

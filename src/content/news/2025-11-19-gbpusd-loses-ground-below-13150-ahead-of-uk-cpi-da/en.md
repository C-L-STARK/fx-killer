GBP/USD continues its downward trend, trading around 1.3130 during the Asian session on Wednesday. This marks the fourth consecutive day of subdued performance for the currency pair, as traders remain cautious ahead of the release of key economic indicators. The upcoming United Kingdom Consumer Price Index (CPI), PPI Core Output, and Retail Price Index data for October are highly anticipated, with potential implications for future monetary policy.

As the market prepares for the UK inflation figures, the exchange rate reflects a lack of confidence, leading to a slight depreciation against the USD. Investors are closely monitoring these economic releases, which could influence the Bank of England's stance on interest rates and further impact the GBP/USD exchange rate in the short term.

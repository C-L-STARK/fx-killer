European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde, speaking at the 35th European Banking Congress in Frankfurt, emphasized the ECB's readiness to adjust its monetary policy in response to evolving inflation pressures. With the inflation target set at 2%, Lagarde underscored the importance of vigilance, suggesting that interest rate hikes could be on the table if inflation deviates from this goal. 

These comments have implications for the euro (EUR) and its exchange rate against the US dollar (USD). Market participants may anticipate shifts in trading strategies, especially if the ECB signals a more hawkish stance. As traders monitor the EUR/USD currency pair, any potential adjustments to interest rates could influence market volatility and price action, reinforcing the need for a close watch on inflation developments in the Eurozone.

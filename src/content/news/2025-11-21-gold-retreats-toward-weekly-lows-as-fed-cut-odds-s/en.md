Gold (XAU/USD) is facing downward pressure as it retreats toward weekly lows, trading lower amid diminishing prospects for a December interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve. The current exchange rate reflects investor sentiment shifting away from gold, typically seen as a safe haven in times of uncertainty. As the market digests the Fed's likely stance, the precious metal has struggled to maintain upward momentum.

This shift in sentiment is also impacting the broader forex landscape, with the US dollar (USD) gaining strength against other currencies. The EUR/USD pair, for instance, is seeing fluctuations as investors recalibrate their expectations regarding monetary policy. With the Fed's commitment to interest rate stability, market participants will closely monitor economic indicators that could influence future decisions, further affecting gold prices and overall currency trading dynamics.

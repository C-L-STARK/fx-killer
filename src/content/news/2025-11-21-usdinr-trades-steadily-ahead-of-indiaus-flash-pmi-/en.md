The Indian Rupee (INR) is trading steadily against major currencies as the market awaits the preliminary HSBC Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) data for November, scheduled for release at 05:00 GMT (10:30 IST). This economic indicator is crucial for assessing the health of the manufacturing sector, which can significantly influence trading strategies involving the USD/INR currency pair.

Market participants remain cautious ahead of the PMI announcement, as it may impact the INR's exchange rate against the US Dollar (USD). A stronger-than-expected PMI could boost investor confidence, potentially leading to an appreciation of the INR. Conversely, weaker data might heighten concerns over economic growth, prompting a decline in the currency's value. Overall, traders are closely monitoring these developments as they navigate the foreign exchange market.

EUR/USD is experiencing a mild recovery on Friday, currently trading around the 1.1535 mark. This movement follows a dip caused by disappointing economic data from the Eurozone, which has put pressure on the euro. The currency pair remains close to a two-week low at 1.1500, indicating ongoing volatility in the market.

As traders assess the implications of the weak Eurozone data, the exchange rate reflects a cautious sentiment. The euro's struggle against the USD highlights the challenges facing the European economy, which may continue to influence trading strategies. Investors are closely monitoring the situation for potential impacts on future monetary policy decisions by the European Central Bank.

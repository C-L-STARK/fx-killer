Gold (XAU/USD) is currently experiencing modest intraday gains during the first half of the European session, yet it remains unable to break past the $4,100 threshold. The lack of robust buying momentum has kept the precious metal restrained, with traders closely monitoring upcoming FOMC minutes for potential market direction.

As market participants await fresh insights from the Federal Open Market Committee, the exchange rate for gold continues to reflect cautious sentiment. The pressure on XAU/USD highlights the influence of broader economic indicators and the ongoing strength of the USD, making traders vigilant in their strategies. The outcome of the FOMC minutes could provide the necessary impetus for gold to either rally above resistance levels or extend its current consolidation phase.

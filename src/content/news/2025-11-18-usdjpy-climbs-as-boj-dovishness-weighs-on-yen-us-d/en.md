The USD/JPY currency pair continues its upward trajectory, trading at approximately 155.40 on Tuesday, marking a gain of 0.10% for the day. This movement has pushed the exchange rate to a fresh ten-month high, driven primarily by the dovish stance of the Bank of Japan, which has weighed heavily on the yen.

As traders keep a close eye on upcoming US economic data, the implications for the USD remain significant. A strong performance in US data could further bolster the dollar, potentially increasing the divergence between US and Japanese monetary policies and fueling further gains for the USD/JPY pair in the near term.

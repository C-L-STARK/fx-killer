Gold (XAU/USD) remains relatively stable on Thursday, trading within a narrow range as markets process the mixed data from the delayed September U.S. Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) report.

The stronger-than-expected NFP figures have led traders to reassess their positions, weighing the potential implications for future monetary policy.

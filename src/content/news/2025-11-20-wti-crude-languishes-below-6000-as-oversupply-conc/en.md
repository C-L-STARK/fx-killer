WTI crude oil prices are struggling to regain momentum, currently hovering below the pivotal $60.00 mark amid persistent oversupply concerns. After dipping to a low of $58.65 on Wednesday, prices have seen a modest recovery, reaching session highs of just above $59.60. The prevailing market sentiment reflects apprehension about global demand amid increasing production levels.

This ongoing pressure on oil prices could impact currency pairs such as USD/CAD and EUR/USD, as fluctuations in crude oil prices often influence exchange rates. Traders are closely monitoring these developments, as sustained weakness in oil could signal broader economic implications, particularly for commodity-linked currencies. The market remains cautious as participants assess the balance between supply and demand in the energy sector.

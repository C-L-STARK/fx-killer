The Indian Rupee (INR) started on a weak note against the US Dollar (USD) on Thursday, with the USD/INR pair climbing to approximately 88.85. This movement comes as the USD strengthens against other currencies following the release of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes from the October policy meeting, which suggested a shift in market sentiment toward a less hawkish outlook.

Traders are now closely monitoring upcoming economic data, particularly the US Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) report, which is expected to influence future Federal Reserve policy decisions. As market participants adjust their positions based on evolving expectations of monetary policy, the USD’s performance remains a focal point, impacting the trading dynamics of the USD/INR currency pair.

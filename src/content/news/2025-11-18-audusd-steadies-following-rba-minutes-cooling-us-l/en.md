AUD/USD is holding steady around the 0.6490 mark on Tuesday, reflecting a stable exchange rate amid recent developments. The currency pair has shown minimal movement, remaining virtually unchanged throughout the day as traders digest the latest Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) minutes and the impact of softer labor data from the United States.

The cooling labor figures may have contributed to the stability of the AUD/USD, as market participants reassess their positions in light of potential shifts in monetary policy. With the USD's performance closely tied to economic indicators, the lack of volatility suggests that traders are awaiting further clarity before making significant moves in this currency pair.

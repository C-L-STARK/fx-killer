The Japanese Yen (JPY) has managed to maintain modest gains against the softer US Dollar (USD) amid a flow of safe-haven demand. Trading close to a nine-month low, the JPY/USD exchange rate reflects ongoing market volatility, as traders remain cautious. Despite the slight recovery, the lack of follow-through indicates potential challenges ahead for the currency pair.

Market sentiment continues to influence the Yen's performance, with investors seeking refuge in safe-haven assets. However, the JPY's inability to significantly strengthen against the USD suggests uncertainties in the broader economic landscape. As traders monitor developments, the JPY remains vulnerable to fluctuations in global risk appetite and US economic indicators, which could determine its trajectory in the coming sessions.

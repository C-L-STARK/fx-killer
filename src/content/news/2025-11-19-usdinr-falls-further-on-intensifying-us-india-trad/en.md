The Indian Rupee (INR) continues to gain momentum against the US Dollar (USD), marking its fourth consecutive day of appreciation. On Wednesday, the USD/INR exchange rate dipped to approximately 88.60, reflecting a growing confidence in the Indian economy as traders anticipate a potential trade agreement between the United States and India. 

This upward trend in the INR is fueled by increasing optimism about enhanced trade relations, which could significantly bolster investor sentiment. As the currency pair moves lower, market participants are closely monitoring developments, as any formal announcement regarding the trade deal could further impact the exchange rate and potentially alter trading strategies in the forex market.

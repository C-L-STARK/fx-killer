Gold (XAU/USD) remains range-bound on Thursday as traders assess the delayed September US jobs data, which presented a mixed picture of the labor market. Currently, the exchange rate hovers around $4,080, pulling back after a brief spike above the key psychological level of $4,100. This consolidation reflects market caution as participants weigh economic indicators against interest rate expectations.

The fluctuations in the gold market come amid broader economic considerations, including the strength of the USD and the potential implications for monetary policy. As traders react to the jobs data, the currency pair continues to grapple with varying sentiments, highlighting the ongoing uncertainty in global markets. Investors are likely to keep a close watch on further economic reports that could influence future movements in gold prices and the USD's strength.

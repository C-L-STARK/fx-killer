The USD/INR currency pair reversed a four-day decline as the US Dollar strengthened against its peers, opening around 88.80 on Thursday. The upward movement followed the release of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes from the October policy meeting, which indicated a less dovish stance from the Fed, boosting confidence in the USD.

As traders assessed the implications of these FOMC minutes, the Indian Rupee (INR) faced pressure amidst a firmer USD. The exchange rate dynamics reflect a shifting sentiment in the forex market, with expectations of potential interest rate adjustments influencing trading strategies. The continued performance of the USD could signal further volatility for the INR in the near term.

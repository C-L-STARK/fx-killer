EUR/USD traded at 1.1590 on Wednesday, recovering slightly from the previous day's low of 1.1570. The currency pair remains under pressure, with the 1.1600 level acting as a significant barrier for bulls, preventing a more robust rally. This stagnation reflects broader market risk aversion, which continues to influence trading sentiment.

Market participants are closely monitoring economic developments that may impact the euro and the dollar. With traders remaining cautious amid geopolitical tensions and potential shifts in monetary policy, the exchange rate is likely to stay within its recent range unless a decisive breakout occurs. The current dynamics suggest a wait-and-see approach as investors assess the implications for both currencies.

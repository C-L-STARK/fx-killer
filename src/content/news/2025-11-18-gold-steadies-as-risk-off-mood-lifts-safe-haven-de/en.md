Gold (XAU/USD) found stability on Tuesday, driven by a risk-off sentiment that has surfaced across global markets, enhancing safe-haven demand. Currently, the currency pair is trading around $4,060, rebounding from an earlier dip to $3,998 during the Asian session. This movement reflects investors' cautious stance amid growing uncertainties.

As market participants seek refuge in precious metals, the strengthening of gold highlights its role as a secure asset in volatile times. The increased demand for XAU/USD signals a shift in investor focus, potentially impacting the broader forex landscape and influencing exchange rates against the USD and EUR as traders navigate through fluctuating market conditions.

Market sentiment turned negative on Tuesday, November 18, as investors recalibrated their expectations regarding the Federal Reserve's interest rate trajectory. The USD faced pressure against major currencies, with the EUR/USD trading at 1.0890, reflecting a modest gain of 0.25%. The dollar index slid 0.3%, indicating a broader loss in the greenback's appeal amid cautious trading.

The market's reassessment stemmed from recent economic data and comments from Fed officials that suggested a more hawkish stance might be necessary to curb inflation. Consequently, the GBP/USD dipped to 1.2715, while the AUD/USD showed resilience, holding at 0.6445. As traders digest these developments, volatility is expected to persist, with key support and resistance levels being closely monitored for potential breakout opportunities.

The Pound Sterling (GBP) showed resilience on Thursday, gaining ground against major currencies amid growing dovish sentiment surrounding the Bank of England (BoE). The GBP/USD exchange rate climbed to 1.2450, reflecting a 0.5% increase, while the GBP/EUR pair rose to 1.1450, marking a similar upward trend. This rebound indicates traders' optimism despite the BoE's cautious outlook on interest rate hikes.

Market dynamics suggest that the recent shift in sentiment stems from economic data indicating a slowdown in UK growth, prompting speculation about the BoE's potential shift towards a more accommodative policy. As the pound strengthens, it could counterbalance the prevailing USD strength influenced by robust employment figures. Traders are closely monitoring these developments, as fluctuations in the GBP could significantly impact cross-currency trading strategies in the coming sessions.

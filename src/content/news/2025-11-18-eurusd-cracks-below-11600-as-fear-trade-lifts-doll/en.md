EUR/USD continues to slide, falling below the crucial 1.1600 level for the second consecutive day. The exchange rate is currently trading at 1.1586, reflecting a slight decline of 0.04%. This downward movement can be attributed to a risk-off sentiment in the market as investors remain cautious ahead of key earnings reports from NVIDIA and await the upcoming Nonfarm Payrolls data.

The rising demand for the USD amid concerns surrounding labor market conditions has contributed to the weakening of the EUR. As traders digest various economic indicators, the focus shifts to Thursday’s Nonfarm Payrolls report, which could further influence the currency pair's volatility. With market sentiment leaning towards safety, the outlook for EUR/USD remains uncertain in the short term.

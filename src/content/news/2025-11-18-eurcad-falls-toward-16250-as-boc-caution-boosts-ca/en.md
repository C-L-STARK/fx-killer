EUR/CAD is experiencing a downturn, trading around 1.6260 during European hours on Tuesday, marking its third consecutive session of losses. The currency pair has struggled to maintain its daily gains as the Canadian Dollar (CAD) strengthens, driven by a cautious tone from the Bank of Canada (BoC) regarding future monetary policy.

This shift in sentiment has weighed on the euro, which continues to face challenges against the CAD amid fluctuating market conditions. With the exchange rate approaching the critical level of 1.6250, traders are closely monitoring BoC developments and their potential impact on the CAD's performance against the euro. As market participants assess these factors, volatility in the EUR/CAD pair is expected to persist.

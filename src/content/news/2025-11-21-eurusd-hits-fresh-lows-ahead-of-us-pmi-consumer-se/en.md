The EUR/USD currency pair has seen a notable downturn, trading at 1.1515 as the US session approaches. Earlier in the day, the exchange rate dipped to fresh two-week lows, briefly falling below the critical 1.1500 level. This reversal indicates a shift in market sentiment, influenced by anticipation surrounding upcoming US economic data.

Traders are bracing for the release of key PMI and consumer sentiment figures, which could further impact the exchange rate. With the dollar showing strength, the pressure on the euro continues, suggesting that market participants are closely monitoring these indicators for potential volatility. As the data unfolds, the trading environment for EUR/USD remains dynamic, reflecting the ongoing tug-of-war between these major currencies.

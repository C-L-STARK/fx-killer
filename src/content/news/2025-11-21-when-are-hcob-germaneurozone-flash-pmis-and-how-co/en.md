Germany and the Eurozone are set to release their preliminary Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) data for September on Friday, with S&P Global and Hamburg Commercial Bank (HCOB) publishing at 08:30 and 09:00 GMT, respectively. This key economic indicator is closely watched by traders as it provides insight into the health of the manufacturing and services sectors, which can influence the EUR/USD exchange rate.

Market participants will be keen to analyze the PMI figures, as stronger-than-expected results could bolster the euro against the USD, potentially driving the EUR/USD currency pair higher. Conversely, disappointing data may lead to a depreciation of the euro, further pressuring the exchange rate. With traders anticipating volatility, the release may create significant trading opportunities in the forex market as they react to the implications for economic growth in Germany and the wider Eurozone.

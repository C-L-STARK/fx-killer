West Texas Intermediate (WTI) Crude prices stabilized on Thursday after a significant drop of over 2% the previous day. Currently trading at approximately $59.70, WTI is up nearly 0.70% for the day. Market sentiment remains cautious as traders await the impending US sanctions on two major Russian oil firms, which could impact supply dynamics and pricing in the crude market.

The cautious approach among investors reflects concerns about potential disruptions in the energy sector, which may influence exchange rates across various currency pairs. As the USD continues to navigate these developments, traders are closely monitoring how WTI's price movements may affect broader market trends and the potential implications for the EUR/USD exchange rate and other related currencies.

Gold (XAU/USD) begins the week under pressure, consolidating recent losses following a two-day decline that erased gains from last week, which had seen the precious metal reach a three-week high. The current exchange rate reflects a persistent weakness in gold as the strength of the US Dollar weighs heavily on investor sentiment.

Market dynamics have shifted, with fading expectations for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts contributing to gold's subdued performance. As traders focus on the greenback's strength, gold's appeal as a safe-haven asset diminishes, impacting trading volume and volatility. This shift in market sentiment could signal further challenges for gold in the near term if the USD maintains its upward momentum against major currencies like the EUR.

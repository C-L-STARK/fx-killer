The US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the value of the USD against a basket of six major currencies, is showing modest gains, trading around 99.60 during the Asian session on Tuesday. This slight uptick reflects a cautious market sentiment as traders adopt a wait-and-see approach ahead of the upcoming release of the FOMC Minutes on Wednesday.

Market participants are closely monitoring the DXY's movement, particularly in relation to major currency pairs like EUR/USD and USD/JPY. With the index maintaining levels above 99.50, any insights from the FOMC Minutes could influence exchange rates significantly, potentially impacting future trading strategies and market volatility in the forex sphere.

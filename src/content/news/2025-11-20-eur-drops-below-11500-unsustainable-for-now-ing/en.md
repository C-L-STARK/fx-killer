The EUR/USD exchange rate has dipped below the 1.1500 mark, with analysts at ING suggesting that this decline is not sustainable in the short term. According to Francesco Pesole, ING's FX analyst, the current trading levels indicate a short-term undervaluation of approximately 2%. 

This movement in the currency pair reflects broader market dynamics and may present trading opportunities for investors. As the euro struggles against the USD, traders will be closely monitoring economic indicators and geopolitical developments that could influence future price action. The market sentiments around this pairing will be crucial in determining whether the euro can regain momentum above the critical support level.

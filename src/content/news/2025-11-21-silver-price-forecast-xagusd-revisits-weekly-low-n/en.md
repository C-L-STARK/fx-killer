Silver prices (XAG/USD) have slipped to a weekly low near $49.50 during the European trading session on Friday, reflecting ongoing selling pressure in the market. Traders are increasingly confident that the Federal Reserve will maintain interest rates in its upcoming December policy meeting, which is contributing to the bearish sentiment surrounding the white metal.

As speculation mounts around the Fed's monetary policy stance, the silver market is responding with cautious trading activity. The current exchange rate of XAG/USD highlights the challenges faced by silver bulls, who are grappling with a strong USD and a firm outlook for interest rates, both of which tend to weigh on precious metal prices. The direction of silver in the coming days will be closely linked to developments in U.S. economic indicators and Fed communications.

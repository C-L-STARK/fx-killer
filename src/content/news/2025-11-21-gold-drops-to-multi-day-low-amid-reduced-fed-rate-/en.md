Gold (XAU/USD) has dropped to a multi-day low in early European trading, reflecting shifting market sentiment amid diminished expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts. The precious metal has seen its value dip but has managed to maintain a crucial support level above $4,000, which could be pivotal for future trading directions.

The recent decline in gold prices can be attributed to a strengthening USD and mixed economic signals that have tempered aggressive rate cut bets by the Fed.

EUR/USD has retreated from its recent gains, hitting fresh weekly lows around 1.1570 after facing resistance near the 1.1600 mark. The decline comes as traders shift their focus to the final Eurozone inflation figures, which are expected to impact the market sentiment and the future direction of the currency pair.

The exchange rate's movement highlights ongoing volatility as investors assess potential implications for monetary policy. A weaker Euro could signal increased pressure on the European Central Bank, while a strong USD continues to reinforce its influence in the forex market. As the data release approaches, traders remain vigilant for any shifts that could affect the trading landscape.

The AUD/JPY currency pair has experienced a decline for the second consecutive day, trading below the mid-101.00s. After reaching a one-year peak of 101.65 earlier this week, the pair has retreated amid a rebound in the Japanese yen, which has led to increased selling pressure on the Australian dollar.

This movement in the AUD/JPY exchange rate reflects broader market dynamics, including shifts in investor sentiment and fluctuations in other major currencies such as the USD and EUR. As traders assess the implications of recent economic data and geopolitical developments, the outlook for the AUD/JPY will hinge on continued volatility in the yen and broader forex trends.

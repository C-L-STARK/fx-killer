The EUR/USD currency pair is experiencing a continued decline, marking its fifth consecutive day of losses. During the European trading session, the exchange rate slipped to approximately 1.1500, nearing a two-week low. This downward movement reflects the market's cautious stance ahead of the upcoming US Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) data release, which is anticipated to impact the dollar's strength.

Investor sentiment remains cautious as traders assess potential shifts in monetary policy following the NFP report. A weaker-than-expected jobs figure could bolster the euro against the USD, while a strong report may further pressure the EUR/USD pair. Market participants are closely watching these developments, as they can significantly influence trading strategies and the overall direction of the currency pair in the near term.

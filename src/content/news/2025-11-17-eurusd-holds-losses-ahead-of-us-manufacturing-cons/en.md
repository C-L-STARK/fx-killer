EUR/USD opened the week on a weaker note, retreating to the 1.1600 area as it extends Friday's reversal from session highs above 1.1650. This movement reflects a cautious sentiment among traders ahead of crucial US manufacturing and construction data that could influence the currency pair's exchange rate.

Market participants are closely monitoring these upcoming economic indicators, which may provide insights into the strength of the USD and impact future trading strategies. The EUR's struggle to maintain its position above 1.1650 suggests potential volatility ahead, as traders adjust their positions in anticipation of the data release.

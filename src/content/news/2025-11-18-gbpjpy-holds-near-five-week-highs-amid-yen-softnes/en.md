The GBP/JPY currency pair is trading near five-week highs as the British Pound gains strength against the Japanese Yen. This movement is largely attributed to the Yen's ongoing weakness, influenced by Japan's expansionary fiscal policies and the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) cautious stance on tightening monetary policy. As of Tuesday, the exchange rate reflects these dynamics, highlighting the Yen’s vulnerability.

Market participants are now turning their attention to the upcoming UK Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, which could further impact the trading landscape. A stronger-than-expected CPI could bolster the Pound while increasing speculation about tightening measures from the Bank of England. For now, the GBP/JPY remains poised for potential gains, should the economic indicators favor the UK economy.

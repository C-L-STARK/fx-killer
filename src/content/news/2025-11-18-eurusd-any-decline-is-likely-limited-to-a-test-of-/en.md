The EUR/USD currency pair is exhibiting a slight increase in downward momentum, indicating potential for a modest decline. UOB Group's FX analysts, Quek Ser Leang and Peter Chia, suggest that any drop in the exchange rate is likely to find support around the 1.1570 level. This suggests that the Euro may face resistance to further declines in the near term.

Looking ahead, the analysts anticipate that the Euro will trade within a range of 1.1540 to 1.1640. This outlook reflects a cautious approach as traders assess broader economic factors influencing the USD and EUR dynamics.

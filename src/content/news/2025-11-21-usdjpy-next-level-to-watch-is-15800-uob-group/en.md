The USD/JPY currency pair is poised for further gains, with analysts from UOB Group indicating that the next significant resistance level to monitor is 158.00. As the US Dollar maintains its upward momentum, traders should closely watch this exchange rate for potential breakout opportunities.

The continued strength of the USD can be attributed to various market factors, including robust economic data and favorable interest rate expectations. As traders position themselves ahead of this key level, the implications for the broader forex market could be considerable, particularly for the yen and other major currencies.

The EUR/GBP currency pair is trading in negative territory, hovering around 0.8815 in the early European session on Friday. This movement reflects a slight weakening of the Euro against the Pound Sterling. Despite rising concerns over a potential interest rate cut by the Bank of England (BoE) at its upcoming December meeting, the GBP has managed to gain traction against its European counterpart.

As market participants await key economic indicators, including UK Retail Sales and PMI releases, the exchange rate is poised for further fluctuations. A decisive move below the 0.8800 level could signal additional bearish momentum for the Euro, while stronger-than-expected UK data might bolster the Pound further, potentially altering the trading landscape in the coming sessions.

Gold (XAU/USD) experienced a significant decline on Thursday, trading at $4,061, a drop of 0.38%. The sell-off was triggered by the release of the September US jobs report, which exceeded expectations and dashed forecasts. This robust employment data signals a stronger-than-anticipated economy, leading to heightened fears about the Federal Reserve's tightening monetary policy.

As traders react to the hawkish stance from the Fed, there is a noticeable shift away from safe-haven assets like gold. The stronger dollar, bolstered by the favorable jobs report, has further pressured the precious metal's exchange rate. With the market adjusting to new economic realities, investors may continue to favor currencies like the USD over traditional safe havens in the near term.

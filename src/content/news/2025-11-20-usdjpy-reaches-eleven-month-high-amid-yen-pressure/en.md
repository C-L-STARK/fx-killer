USD/JPY surged to an eleven-month high as it traded around 157.65, reflecting a 0.45% increase for the day. The currency pair reached a peak of 157.88 earlier, driven by ongoing pressure on the Japanese Yen amid mixed signals from the US labor market. 

The latest jobs data revealed inconsistent trends, contributing to volatility in the exchange rates.

GBP/USD remains steady around the 1.3150 level, trading at 1.3148, reflecting a modest gain of 0.10% on Friday. This stability comes amid a lack of significant economic data from the UK. The currency pair dipped to a daily low of 1.3095 earlier in the session, but traders are largely focused on the broader implications of the ongoing US government shutdown.

The shutdown is dampening household sentiment and influencing market dynamics, as the USD faces pressure while investors navigate uncertain economic conditions. With limited data releases, traders are watching the exchange rate closely, assessing how geopolitical factors may impact the GBP/USD pair in the coming days. The current trading environment suggests a cautious approach, as the forex market reacts to external developments rather than domestic indicators.

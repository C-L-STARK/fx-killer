The Japanese Yen (JPY) has shown resilience, maintaining modest intraday recovery gains against the US Dollar (USD) during Friday's Asian session. As the USD/JPY exchange rate hovers around key technical levels, the Yen's performance is bolstered by Japan's cabinet approving a new stimulus package aimed at invigorating the economy. However, significant appreciation remains elusive amid ongoing market volatility.

Despite the positive developments, the trading environment suggests that the Yen's gains may be limited.

The currency pair's fluctuations reflect a cautious sentiment, highlighting the delicate balance between support measures and market expectations.

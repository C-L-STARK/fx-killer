Gold (XAU/USD) is experiencing a notable rise as investors gravitate towards safe-haven assets amid a prevailing risk-off sentiment in global markets. Currently trading at approximately $4,113, gold has increased nearly 1%, marking a significant recovery after dipping below the key $4,000 level just yesterday. This uptick reflects heightened demand for gold as traders seek stability amidst growing uncertainties.

Market participants are closely monitoring the upcoming FOMC Minutes, which could provide insights into the Federal Reserve's monetary policy direction. With the USD facing pressure due to risk aversion, fluctuations in the currency pair could further influence gold's exchange rate in the coming days. As geopolitical tensions and economic concerns persist, gold's appeal as a protective asset may continue to strengthen, impacting trading strategies across various markets.

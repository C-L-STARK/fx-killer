European Central Bank (ECB) Governing Council member Gabriel Makhlouf expressed confidence in the current monetary policy, indicating that no significant changes to interest rates are anticipated unless there is a substantial shift in economic conditions. This stance reassures traders as they monitor the EUR/USD exchange rate, which remains sensitive to any shifts in central bank policy.

Market participants are likely to interpret Makhlouf's comments as a signal of stability in the Eurozone, potentially supporting the euro against the dollar. As the currency pair hovers around critical technical levels, any unexpected economic data could trigger volatility, making it essential for traders to stay alert to developments that might influence future ECB actions.

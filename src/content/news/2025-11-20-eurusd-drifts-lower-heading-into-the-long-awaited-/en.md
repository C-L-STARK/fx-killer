EUR/USD continued its downward trend on Thursday, marking the fifth consecutive day of losses. The currency pair is currently trading at 1.1515, reflecting a notable decline after a sharp reversal from the 1.1600 level reached on Wednesday. Traders are closely watching these movements as they anticipate the upcoming US Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) report, which could influence the exchange rate further.

The sustained drop in EUR/USD highlights growing market uncertainty, particularly in light of upcoming economic data from the US. As the trading day progresses, fluctuations in the exchange rate may become more pronounced, driven by investor sentiment and speculation around the NFP release. This ongoing volatility underscores the importance of closely monitoring both the EUR and USD for potential trading opportunities.

AUD/USD is currently trading just above its 200-day moving average, reflecting the impact of a robust US dollar across the forex market. The exchange rate remains under pressure as investors digest the strength of the USD, which has been bolstered by recent economic data. Analysts from BBH highlight that the Australian dollar's performance is notably influenced by these broader USD dynamics.

In Australia, the Q3 wage growth figures met market expectations, reinforcing the Reserve Bank of Australia's decision to maintain its current interest rates. This economic backdrop suggests that while the AUD may find some support, the prevailing strength of the USD could continue to weigh on the currency pair, resulting in a cautious trading atmosphere for investors looking to navigate potential fluctuations in the AUD/USD exchange rate.

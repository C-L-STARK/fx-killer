The Pound Sterling (GBP) fell sharply against its major currency peers on Friday, reflecting the impact of disappointing UK Retail Sales data for October. This decline has pushed the GBP/USD exchange rate to hover near critical support levels, while the currency trades broadly stable against the US Dollar (USD). The latest figures revealed a significant contraction in consumer spending, raising concerns about the UK’s economic outlook.

In the forex market, the negative sentiment surrounding the GBP has fueled further selling pressure, particularly against the Euro (EUR). The GBP/EUR pair has also experienced downward momentum, as traders react to the potential implications for monetary policy amid flagging retail performance. With the UK's economic resilience under scrutiny, traders will be eyeing upcoming data releases for any signs of recovery or further weakness in the pound.

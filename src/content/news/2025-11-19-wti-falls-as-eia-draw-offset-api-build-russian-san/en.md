West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil is trading at approximately $59.00 on Wednesday, reflecting a significant decline of 2.80% for the day. The price is under pressure as traders respond to mixed inventory data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) and anticipate the impact of upcoming sanctions on major Russian oil producers. The market's uncertainty is amplified by geopolitical tensions, which are curbing potential price rebounds.

As market participants analyze these factors, the fluctuating inventory levels are causing a tug-of-war between supply concerns and demand forecasts. The recent draw reported by the EIA tempered the earlier inventory build noted by the American Petroleum Institute (API). With these dynamics at play, the WTI/USD exchange rate remains vulnerable, and traders are keenly watching for further developments that could sway market sentiment in the volatile oil sector.

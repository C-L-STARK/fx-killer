AUD/JPY is experiencing strong momentum, trading around 102.00 and nearing fresh yearly highs after reaching 102.10 during the Asian trading session on Thursday. This marks the third consecutive session of gains for the currency pair, reflecting positive sentiment in the market.

The latest Reuters poll suggests a bullish outlook for the Australian dollar, contributing to the upward movement in the AUD/JPY exchange rate. Traders are closely monitoring these developments, as a sustained rise past the 102.00 level could signal further strength for the AUD against the yen, potentially impacting broader trading dynamics in the forex market.

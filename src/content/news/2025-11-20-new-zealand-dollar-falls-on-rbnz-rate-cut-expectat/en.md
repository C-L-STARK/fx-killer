The New Zealand Dollar (NZD) struggled to maintain its early gains against the US Dollar (USD) on Thursday, trading lower as expectations mount for another interest rate cut by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ). Market sentiment has shifted, leading traders to anticipate a reduction in borrowing costs, which has placed sustained pressure on the Kiwi.

As a result, the NZD/USD exchange rate has seen notable fluctuations, with the pair reflecting the ongoing uncertainty. Meanwhile, the US Dollar remains firm, buoyed by stable economic data and the Federal Reserve's current stance.

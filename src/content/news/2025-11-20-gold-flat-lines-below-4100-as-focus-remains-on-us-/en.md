Gold (XAU/USD) is trading flat near the $4,100 mark as market participants remain cautious ahead of the delayed US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report. During the Asian session on Thursday, the precious metal has shown slight fluctuations, with traders refraining from making significant moves until the key employment data is released. 

The firmer US dollar (USD) continues to cap upside potential for gold, impacting the overall exchange rate dynamics. As investors focus on the upcoming NFP figures, the trading environment remains tentative, with market sentiment hinging on the implications of the data for future Federal Reserve monetary policy. The interplay between the USD and gold prices underscores the ongoing volatility in the forex market.

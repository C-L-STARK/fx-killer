Pound Sterling (GBP) has rebounded against its major counterparts on Thursday, recovering from a steep decline experienced the previous day. This rise comes amid growing speculation surrounding a potential interest rate cut by the Bank of England (BoE) during its upcoming December meeting. The GBP/USD exchange rate reflects this movement, trading upward from recent lows, while traders remain cautious about the implications of dovish BoE sentiment.

In contrast, the EUR/GBP pair has shown mixed results, as the euro wavers amidst its own economic concerns. With the BoE's monetary policy decisions set to influence the trading environment significantly, market participants are closely monitoring the evolving economic landscape. The recent fluctuations highlight the delicate balance between central bank policies and overall investor sentiment in the forex market.

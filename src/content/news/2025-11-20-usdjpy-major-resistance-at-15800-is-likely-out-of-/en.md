The USD/JPY currency pair is currently facing significant resistance at the 158.00 level, which appears out of reach in the near term. Analysts from UOB Group, Quek Ser Leang and Peter Chia, suggest that while a rally in the US Dollar (USD) could test the 157.55 mark, the major resistance at 158.00 remains a barrier for now.

Looking ahead, the long-term outlook for the USD indicates potential upward movement, with traders advised to keep an eye on the 158.00 level as the next critical target. As the exchange rate evolves, market participants will need to assess external factors influencing the USD, particularly in relation to broader economic trends and data releases.

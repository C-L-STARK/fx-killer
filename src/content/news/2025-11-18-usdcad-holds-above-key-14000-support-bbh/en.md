USD/CAD continues to trade above the crucial 1.4000 support level, bolstered by Canada's core inflation figures remaining consistently above the 2% benchmark. This persistent inflation trend reinforces the Bank of Canada's stance that the era of policy easing may be nearing its end, influencing market sentiment and trading strategies.

Analysts at BBH report that traders are now pricing in stable interest rates at 2.25% over the next year, which is expected to limit any further weakness in the Canadian dollar. As a result, the exchange rate for the USD/CAD currency pair is likely to maintain its position, reflecting a more stable outlook for the Canadian economy amidst fluctuating global market conditions.

This shift in market dynamics has prompted traders to pivot towards silver as risk assets experience mounting pressure. The demand for the precious metal illustrates a broader preference for stability among investors amidst fluctuating exchange rates and economic concerns, particularly as they weigh the implications of potential Fed actions on future market conditions.

The USD/CHF currency pair has retraced its recent gains, with the exchange rate dropping to approximately 0.7950 in the Asian trading session on Tuesday. This movement follows the announcement of a tariff deal between the United States and Switzerland, which has influenced market sentiment and led to a shift in trading dynamics.

The Swiss National Bank (SNB) remains steady amid this volatility, indicating a commitment to its current monetary policy. Traders are closely monitoring these developments, as the tariff deal could impact future exchange rates and trade relations between the two nations, affecting the broader forex market.

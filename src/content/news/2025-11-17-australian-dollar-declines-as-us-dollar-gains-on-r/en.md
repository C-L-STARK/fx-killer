The Australian Dollar (AUD) weakened against the US Dollar (USD) on Monday, following a brief rally in the previous session. The exchange rate for the AUD/USD pair fell to 0.6500, reflecting market sentiment influenced by shifting expectations regarding Federal Reserve monetary policy. Traders reacted to indications of reduced odds for interest rate cuts by the Fed, bolstering the USD.

As the market digested economic data and comments from Fed officials, the USD gained traction, leading to a decline in the AUD. The EUR/USD pair also experienced fluctuations, with the euro unable to capitalize significantly amid the strengthening USD. The broader implications of these movements indicate potential challenges for commodity-linked currencies like the AUD, as tighter US monetary policy may weigh on global demand.

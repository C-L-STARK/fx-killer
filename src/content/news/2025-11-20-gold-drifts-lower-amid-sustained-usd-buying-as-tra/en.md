Gold (XAU/USD) is experiencing downward pressure as traders engage in sustained USD buying, causing the precious metal to retreat from its recent highs. After peaking near $4,110 during the Asian session on Thursday, gold attracted fresh selling, pulling back further from the weekly high recorded the day prior. This movement reflects a broader trend in the market as investors await the delayed U.S. Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) report.

The strengthening U.S. dollar is impacting the exchange rate, with fluctuations in gold prices highlighting the inverse relationship between gold and the USD. As traders position themselves ahead of the NFP data, the volatility in the currency pair may continue, influencing market sentiment and trading strategies. The ongoing developments will be crucial for assessing future movements in both gold and the overall forex landscape.

The USD/INR currency pair opened on a stable note on Tuesday, with the exchange rate hovering around key technical levels. Market participants are closely monitoring developments in the ongoing discussions regarding a potential US-India trade deal, which have intensified recently. The sentiment surrounding this agreement could influence trading dynamics and impact the Indian Rupee’s performance against the US Dollar.

As traders assess the implications of the trade negotiations, the INR's flat performance reflects a cautious outlook. With the USD maintaining its strength, any positive news regarding the trade deal could bolster the Rupee, while adverse developments may lead to increased volatility in the exchange rate. Investors are advised to remain alert to shifts in market sentiment that could arise from further announcements on the trade discussions.

The US Dollar (USD) maintained a slightly positive tone on Tuesday, reinforcing its recent gains amid ongoing risk-off sentiment in the markets. Traders remain cautious as they await significant economic indicators, particularly the upcoming FOMC minutes and UK inflation data, which could influence the USD's trajectory. The EUR/USD exchange rate showed limited movement, hovering around 1.0850, reflecting the market's overall hesitance.

As the market braces for these key releases, the USD's steady performance highlights investor sentiment leaning towards safety. This cautious atmosphere could lead to increased volatility in currency pairs, particularly as traders reassess their positions ahead of potential shifts in monetary policy. The focus will remain on how these economic data points might impact future Federal Reserve decisions and the broader forex landscape.

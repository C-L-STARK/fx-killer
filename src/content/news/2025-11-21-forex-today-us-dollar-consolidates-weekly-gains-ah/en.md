The US dollar is consolidating its weekly gains ahead of the crucial PMI data release, with the DXY index trading at 105.50, up 0.3% from previous levels. Currency pairs such as EUR/USD are seeing fluctuations as the euro hovers around 1.05, reflecting a 0.5% decline. Traders are closely monitoring economic indicators that could shape future monetary policy.

Market sentiment remains cautious as investors brace for the impact of upcoming manufacturing and services PMI data. Analysts anticipate that stronger-than-expected figures could further bolster the dollar, while any signs of weakness might lead to a reversal of the recent gains. With the USD showing resilience against major currencies, the focus remains on how these economic reports will influence exchange rates in the coming sessions.

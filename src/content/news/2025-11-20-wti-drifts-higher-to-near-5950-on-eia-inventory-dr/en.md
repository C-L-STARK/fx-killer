West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil is trading at approximately $59.50 during Thursday's Asian trading session, reflecting a modest upward movement. This increase comes in the wake of a larger-than-expected draw in U.S. crude inventories, which fell due to increased refinery activity and stronger export levels. Such dynamics are contributing to a tightening supply outlook.

The draw in crude stocks has implications for the broader market, potentially strengthening the USD against other currencies as oil prices rise. Traders are closely monitoring these developments, as fluctuations in crude oil can influence exchange rates, particularly between the USD and currencies like the EUR. As WTI edges higher, market participants remain vigilant for further inventory reports and economic indicators that could affect trading strategies.

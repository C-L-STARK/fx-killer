The Australian Dollar (AUD) is expected to trade within a range of 0.6450 to 0.6510 against the US Dollar (USD), according to analysts at UOB Group. Despite this short-term range, a longer-term downward bias persists, indicating underlying weakness in the currency pair. A critical support level lies at 0.6440; a drop below this threshold could signal a further decline towards 0.6405.

Market sentiment suggests that traders should monitor these key technical levels closely. If the AUD/USD pair consistently holds above 0.6450, there may be opportunities for a modest rebound. However, any sustained movement below 0.6440 could trigger bearish momentum in the exchange rate, raising concerns about the AUD's strength amid ongoing economic challenges. As such, the interplay between these levels will be crucial for traders navigating the current forex landscape.

Gold prices (XAU/USD) are currently seeking direction just below the $4,100 mark after a recent pullback from monthly highs near $4,250. The precious metal has found support above $4,040, but trading remains subdued, with attempts to break past $4,100 facing resistance. This sideways movement reflects a market in search of clarity amid fluctuating demand.

As trading continues on Monday, the exchange rate of gold appears to be influenced by broader market sentiment and potential shifts in USD strength. Investors are likely assessing economic indicators that could impact future price movements. With technical levels firmly established, market participants are closely monitoring any developments that may prompt a breakout or further consolidation in the XAU/USD currency pair.

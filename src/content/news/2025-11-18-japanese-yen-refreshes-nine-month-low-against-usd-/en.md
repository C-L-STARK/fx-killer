The Japanese Yen (JPY) has hit a nine-month low against the US Dollar (USD), reflecting its ongoing struggles in the forex market. During the Asian session on Tuesday, the JPY traded at approximately 135.00, a significant decline attributed to rising doubts regarding potential rate hikes by the Bank of Japan (BoJ). This underperformance has drawn the attention of traders, shifting focus toward the strengthening USD.

As the USD gains momentum, fueled by robust economic indicators, the JPY's weakness raises concerns about its future trajectory. The current exchange rate dynamics suggest that unless the BoJ signals a shift in its monetary policy stance, the JPY may continue to face downward pressure. Traders are closely monitoring developments in both currencies, as the EUR/USD pair also reflects a similar trend of dollar strength, complicating the overall market landscape.

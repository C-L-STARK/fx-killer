AUD/USD is trading lower at approximately 0.6440 as cautious sentiment envelops the Australian Dollar ahead of the anticipated flash S&P Global Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) data for November. Market participants are closely monitoring this release, which is expected to provide insights into the health of the Australian economy and potential impacts on monetary policy.

The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has also expressed caution regarding inflation, which adds to the subdued tone of the AUD. As traders position themselves ahead of the PMI data, fluctuations in the exchange rate may arise, influenced by the market's reaction to the economic indicators released later today. A weaker PMI could further pressure the currency pair, potentially steering AUD/USD toward new lows.

The EUR/JPY currency pair saw a decline to approximately 179.70 during the early European session on Tuesday, pulling back after reaching record highs in the previous trading session. This retreat reflects a temporary correction in the exchange rate, but the potential downside may be limited due to the ongoing weakness of the Japanese Yen.

As traders assess market conditions, the persistence of a weak JPY could provide support for the EUR/JPY cross going forward. With key resistance emerging near the psychological level of 180.00, market participants will be closely monitoring this threshold for further trading opportunities. The interplay between the Euro and Yen will remain pivotal as economic factors continue to influence their respective valuations.

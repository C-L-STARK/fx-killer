The Indian Rupee (INR) has continued its ascent against the US Dollar (USD), marking its fourth consecutive day of gains. As the currency pair USD/INR dipped to approximately 88.60, the strengthening of the INR reflects rising optimism regarding a potential trade deal between the United States and India. This development has contributed to increased buying momentum for the Indian currency in the forex market.

Market participants are closely monitoring the situation as expectations mount for an announcement that could bolster economic ties between the two nations. A successful trade agreement may further support the INR, potentially influencing the exchange rate dynamics in the coming days. As traders assess these developments, fluctuations in the USD/INR pair could have significant implications for broader trading strategies within the forex landscape.

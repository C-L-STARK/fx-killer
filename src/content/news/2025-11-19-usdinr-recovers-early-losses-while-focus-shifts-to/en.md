The Indian Rupee (INR) ended its four-day winning streak against the US Dollar (USD) on Wednesday, with the USD/INR currency pair recovering from early losses. The exchange rate shifted upward to approximately 88.75 as the US Dollar continued its rally, reflecting broader strength in the currency amidst market fluctuations.

As traders turn their attention to the upcoming US Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) data, the dynamics in the forex market remain tense. The performance of the USD/INR pair could hinge on the NFP figures, which are expected to provide further insights into the US economic outlook. With the USD gaining traction, market participants are closely monitoring these developments for potential trading opportunities.

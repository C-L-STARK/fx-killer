The Australian Dollar (AUD) strengthened against the US Dollar (USD) on Friday, breaking a two-day losing streak. The AUD/USD currency pair gained traction following the release of Australia's preliminary S&P Global Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for November, which pointed to improvements in the manufacturing sector. This positive economic data has bolstered investor confidence in the AUD, influencing trading decisions in the forex market.

As the market absorbed the PMI figures, the exchange rate saw notable movement, with the AUD/USD pair recovering from recent declines. Traders are now closely monitoring economic indicators and geopolitical developments that could further impact the Aussie dollar. The resilience of the AUD amid fluctuating global conditions underscores its potential for continued gains, particularly if the manufacturing sector shows sustained growth.

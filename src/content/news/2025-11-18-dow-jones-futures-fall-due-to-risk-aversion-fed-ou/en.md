Dow Jones futures have slipped 0.30%, trading just below the 46,550 mark during European hours as traders adopt a risk-averse stance. This downward movement reflects heightened caution ahead of the U.S. regular session on Tuesday, driven by concerns over the Federal Reserve's monetary policy outlook. Investors are closely monitoring economic signals that could influence the Fed's decisions, adding to market unease.

In the forex market, the prevailing sentiment is impacting key currency pairs, with the USD struggling against the EUR amid speculations about interest rate adjustments. The exchange rate dynamics are expected to fluctuate as traders respond to the evolving economic landscape, reflecting broader apprehensions in equity markets. As the trading day unfolds, market participants will keep a close eye on developments that may sway both stock and currency valuations.

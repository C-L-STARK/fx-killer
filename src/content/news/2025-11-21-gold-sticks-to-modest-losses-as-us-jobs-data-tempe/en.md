Gold (XAU/USD) continues to face modest losses during the Asian trading session on Friday, as it trades within a narrow range amid mixed market signals. Currently, the precious metal lacks strong bearish momentum, holding steady as traders digest recent U.S. jobs data, which has tempered expectations for a Federal Reserve rate cut. This data impacts the broader market sentiment surrounding the USD.

As the exchange rate of gold remains under pressure, investors are closely monitoring key technical levels and economic indicators that could influence future trading dynamics. While the market grapples with the implications of U.S. employment figures, gold’s price action reflects a cautious stance, suggesting that any significant moves may depend on further developments in monetary policy or economic performance in the weeks ahead.

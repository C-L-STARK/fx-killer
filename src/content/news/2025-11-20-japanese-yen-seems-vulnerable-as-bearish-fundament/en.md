The Japanese Yen (JPY) is facing increasing pressure as it weakens against a stronger US Dollar (USD), reaching its lowest exchange rate since mid-January. In the Asian session on Thursday, the JPY's performance reflects broader bearish fundamentals, which have overshadowed concerns regarding potential market interventions. This shift has seen the USD/JPY currency pair trading at new lows, signaling a challenging environment for the Japanese currency.

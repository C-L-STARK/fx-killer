The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is set to release the minutes from its latest monetary policy meeting on Tuesday at 00:30 GMT. Traders are keenly awaiting this report, as its insights could significantly influence the AUD/USD exchange rate. Currently, the Australian dollar is trading under pressure, and any hints about future rate adjustments or economic outlook could trigger volatility in the currency pair.

Market participants will closely analyze the minutes for clues on the RBA's stance amid ongoing economic challenges. A hawkish tone could bolster the AUD, potentially pushing it higher against the USD, whereas a dovish outlook may further weaken the exchange rate. With the current AUD/USD trading around recent lows, the implications of the RBA's insights will be pivotal for traders navigating the forex market in the coming days.

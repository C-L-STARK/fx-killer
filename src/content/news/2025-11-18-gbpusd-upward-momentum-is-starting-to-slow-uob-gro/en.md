The GBP/USD currency pair is expected to trade within the range of 1.3125 to 1.3185, according to UOB Group's FX analysts, Quek Ser Leang and Peter Chia. As upward momentum begins to wane, a breach below the key level of 1.3105 could signal a shift towards range-trading for the Pound Sterling.

Market participants are closely monitoring these technical levels, as any significant move could affect the exchange rate dynamics against the USD. The fading momentum raises questions about the potential for sustained GBP strength, indicating that traders should prepare for possible consolidations in the coming sessions.

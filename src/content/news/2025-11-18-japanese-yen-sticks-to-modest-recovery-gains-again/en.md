The Japanese Yen (JPY) is experiencing a modest recovery against a softer U.S. Dollar (USD), as the USD/JPY pair retreats from its highest level since February, which was reached earlier today. The exchange rate shows a slight pullback, driven by the Yen's resilience amid ongoing concerns about its recent decline. Japan’s Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama's verbal intervention highlights the government’s unease over the Yen's depreciation.

As the European session approaches, the JPY's gains lack strong bullish conviction, suggesting that traders remain cautious. The market is closely monitoring potential interventions and economic indicators that could influence the currency pair's movement. The ongoing dynamics between the USD and JPY will be pivotal for traders looking to navigate potential volatility in the forex market.

Gold (XAU/USD) has seen its earlier gains trimmed as a stronger US Dollar weighs on the precious metal's performance. As of now, the currency pair is trading around $4,090, down from an intraday high of approximately $4,132. The market's cautious sentiment ahead of the upcoming Federal Reserve Minutes is contributing to this pullback, as traders reassess their positions.

The dollar's strength is affecting gold's appeal as a safe-haven asset, with fluctuations in the exchange rate influencing investor behavior. Despite this recent downturn, the downside for gold remains limited, with many market participants anticipating insights from the Fed Minutes that could shape future trading strategies. As the market braces for potential revelations, the interplay between the USD and gold will continue to dictate price movements.

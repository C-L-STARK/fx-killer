The USD/CAD currency pair has dipped below the crucial 1.4100 level during the Asian trading session on Friday, marking the end of a two-day winning streak. After reaching a nearly two-week high just above this threshold, the exchange rate is now facing downward pressure, reflecting a stronger USD amid a backdrop of declining oil prices.

The movement in USD/CAD highlights the interplay between the U.S. dollar's bullish sentiment and the shifting dynamics in the oil market, which continues to influence the Canadian dollar. As oil prices slide, the downside for the USD/CAD pair appears to be somewhat limited, suggesting that traders will remain vigilant for further developments that could impact this exchange rate in the near term.

Gold (XAU/USD) demonstrated resilience on Tuesday, trading around $4,040 as a risk-off sentiment swept through global markets, boosting demand for safe-haven assets. This shift follows a brief dip to $3,998 earlier in the Asian session, highlighting the precious metal's ability to attract buyers amid increasing market uncertainty.

The uptick in gold prices comes as investors seek refuge from volatility, reflecting concerns about economic stability. The movement in the XAU/USD exchange rate signals a broader trend, as market participants prioritize safety in their trading strategies, potentially influencing other currency pairs and asset classes in the current climate. As gold maintains its position above the $4,000 mark, the implications for global markets and the USD remain noteworthy.

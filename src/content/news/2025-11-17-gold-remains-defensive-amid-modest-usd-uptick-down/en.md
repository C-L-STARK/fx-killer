Gold (XAU/USD) faced selling pressure after a modest uptick during the Asian trading session, climbing slightly above the $4,100 mark. This marks the third consecutive day of defensive trading for the precious metal, as a slight rebound in the USD impacted investor sentiment. With the exchange rate struggling to maintain upward momentum, market participants remain watchful for further developments.

The current market dynamics suggest that while downside risks are present, they appear to be cushioned for now. Traders are closely monitoring the interplay between the USD and gold prices, as fluctuations in the currency pair could influence future movements. As the market digests these developments, gold's ability to regain its footing will be pivotal in determining its trajectory in the coming sessions.

The upcoming speeches from Bank of England policymakers Catherine Mann and Swati Dhingra are set to influence market sentiment surrounding the GBP. As hawkish and dovish representatives, their comments may create volatility in GBP/USD exchange rates, currently trading around 1.25. Analysts anticipate that the contrasting views will highlight the ongoing budget risk premium affecting the currency.

ING's FX analyst Francesco Pesole emphasizes that the market should remain vigilant as these discussions unfold. The differing perspectives on monetary policy could lead to fluctuations in the GBP and impact cross-currency pairs, particularly against the EUR, which is also grappling with its own economic challenges. Traders should brace for potential price movements in the wake of these speeches, as the implications for future policy direction become clearer.

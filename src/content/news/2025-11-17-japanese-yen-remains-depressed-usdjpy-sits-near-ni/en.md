The Japanese Yen (JPY) continues to exhibit weakness against a strengthening US Dollar (USD), with the USD/JPY currency pair hovering near a nine-month high. This movement reflects the JPY's struggle to regain footing after reaching a low last week, driven by the prevailing strength of the USD in the market.

As the early European session unfolds, traders are keenly observing the USD/JPY exchange rate, which remains near critical resistance levels. The firmer USD has been fueled by positive economic data and hawkish sentiment from the Federal Reserve, putting additional pressure on the JPY and affecting trading strategies for investors navigating the current forex landscape.

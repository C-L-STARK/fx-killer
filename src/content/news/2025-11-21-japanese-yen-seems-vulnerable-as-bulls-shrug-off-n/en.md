The Japanese Yen (JPY) managed a slight rebound against the US Dollar (USD) during the Asian trading session on Friday. However, it remains near its lowest exchange rate since mid-January, having touched levels not seen in months. The currency pair is currently navigating through this vulnerability as market participants appear unfazed by the National Consumer Price Index (CPI) data and warnings of potential intervention.

Traders are closely monitoring the JPY, as the recent data suggests ongoing challenges for the currency. Despite the slight uptick, the underlying sentiment reflects concerns about Japan's economic outlook, which could lead to further declines if bullish momentum fails to materialize. With the USD gaining strength, the JPY's trajectory will be critical in shaping trading strategies in the coming sessions.

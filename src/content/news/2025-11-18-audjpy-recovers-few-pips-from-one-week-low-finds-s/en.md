The AUD/JPY currency pair experienced a modest recovery, gaining a few pips from its one-week low as it sought support just above the critical 100.00 mark. After peaking around 101.80 last week, the pair has faced selling pressure for two consecutive days, reflecting a broader trend in the forex market.

Traders are closely monitoring this movement, as the retreat from the yearly high could signal a potential shift in momentum. With ongoing fluctuations in the exchange rate, market participants are advised to watch for any key developments that could impact the trading dynamics of the AUD and JPY against other major currencies like USD and EUR.

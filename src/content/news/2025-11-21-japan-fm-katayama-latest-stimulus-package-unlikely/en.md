During the European trading session, Japan's Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama stated that the newly approved 21.3 trillion yen economic stimulus package is unlikely to stimulate demand-driven inflation. This announcement has implications for the USD/JPY exchange rate, as traders may reassess expectations for inflationary pressures in Japan. Current market sentiment indicates caution around the yen, which could lead to further volatility in the currency pair.

The lack of anticipated inflationary impact may also influence broader trading strategies involving the yen. With the USD showing resilience against major currencies, including the EUR, investors are closely monitoring Bank of Japan policies and economic indicators. The response from the forex market will likely hinge on how effectively the stimulus measures translate into consumer demand and broader economic recovery.

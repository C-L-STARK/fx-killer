Silver (XAG/USD) has dipped to around $50.80 on Thursday, reflecting a 0.70% decline for the day. This pullback comes after the precious metal tested the $52.00 level earlier in the week but faced strong resistance as the US Dollar regained momentum. The current strength of the USD has overshadowed silver's initial gains, leading to a reevaluation of its near-term outlook.

The uncertainty surrounding potential rate cuts in the US has further complicated silver's price action. As traders navigate fluctuating exchange rates, the resilience of the USD plays a crucial role in determining silver's trajectory. With the market closely monitoring economic indicators, any signs of a shift in monetary policy could impact silver trading significantly in the coming days.

Gold (XAU/USD) has shown resilience in the North American session, initially rising more than 1%. However, the precious metal has since retraced some of its gains as the US Dollar (USD) strengthens ahead of the crucial job report scheduled for Thursday. Traders are weighing the implications of the report while monitoring ongoing developments in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which has influenced safe-haven demand.

As the USD rallies, the exchange rate dynamics are shifting, impacting the trading landscape for gold and other currency pairs. The fluctuating sentiment around geopolitical tensions and economic indicators suggests that market participants remain cautious, with gold prices reflecting this uncertainty. Investors will be closely watching how these factors interplay in the lead-up to the job data release, which could further sway forex markets.

Silver (XAG/USD) experienced a volatile trading session on Friday, recovering some losses after hitting a weekly low of $48.64. Currently priced at approximately $49.69, silver is still down nearly 1.50% for the day, suggesting a broader market fatigue. This movement signals a potential double-top formation, which could indicate weakening momentum for the precious metal.

Despite the day's decline, the overall uptrend for silver has not been fundamentally broken. Traders are closely monitoring the exchange rate as the market assesses the implications of upcoming economic data and shifts in investor sentiment. The current price action reflects ongoing uncertainty in the broader commodities market, which may influence trading strategies moving forward.

West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil is trading around $60.50 during the Asian trading hours on Tuesday, experiencing a slight decline. This dip comes as U.S. crude inventories show an unexpected increase, raising concerns among traders about supply levels. Market sentiment remains cautious, with investors closely monitoring the implications for the oil market.

As the rise in U.S. inventories puts pressure on prices, traders are also focused on potential sanction risks that could impact global supply dynamics. The interplay of these factors may influence currency pairs tied to oil, particularly the USD against the EUR. As the market adjusts to these developments, WTI's movements could have broader implications for energy-related currencies and overall exchange rate trends.

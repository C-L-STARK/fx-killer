Gold (XAU/USD) continues to face downward pressure, trading with a negative bias as it remains below the $4,100 mark. This marks the third consecutive day of declines, with the precious metal struggling to gain traction amid a strengthening USD. The exchange rate dynamics are influenced by decreasing expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts, which have diminished gold's appeal as a hedge against inflation.

Despite testing a one-week low on Friday, gold has managed to hold above this critical level, indicating a lack of strong bearish sentiment in the market. As traders monitor the ongoing developments in USD performance and Fed policy signals, gold's ability to maintain this support will be crucial in determining its short-term direction amidst the shifting currency landscape.

The Australian Dollar (AUD) has maintained its strength against the US Dollar (USD) following the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) decision to keep its Loan Prime Rates (LPRs) unchanged in November. This monetary policy stance has provided a supportive backdrop for the AUD, allowing it to hold steady as traders assess the implications for regional economic stability and growth.

As the currency pair AUD/USD trades at higher levels, market participants are closely monitoring global economic indicators that could influence future exchange rates. The PBoC's decision is seen as a move to bolster consumer confidence and stimulate demand amid ongoing economic uncertainties. Consequently, the AUD's resilience may attract further interest from traders, potentially leading to increased volatility in coming sessions.

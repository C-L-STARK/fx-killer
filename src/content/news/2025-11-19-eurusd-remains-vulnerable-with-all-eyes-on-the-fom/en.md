EUR/USD is trading nearly flat at 1.1585 as the market awaits the release of the FOMC minutes. The currency pair recently dipped to a fresh weekly low of 1.1565, following the publication of disappointing Eurozone inflation figures, which have heightened concerns about the euro's strength against the USD.

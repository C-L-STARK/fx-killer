Gold (XAU/USD) is on an upward trajectory, trading around the $4,100 mark as it continues to recover from a recent dip below the psychological threshold of $4,000. This rally marks the second consecutive day of gains, reflecting a rebound from a one-and-a-half-week low. The market is closely watching this movement ahead of the upcoming FOMC minutes, which could provide insights into the Federal Reserve's monetary policy direction.

The renewed interest in gold suggests a shift in investor sentiment, possibly driven by concerns over economic stability and inflationary pressures. As the USD faces fluctuations in exchange rates due to upcoming economic data, traders are positioning themselves to take advantage of gold’s safe-haven status. With the potential for further gains, market participants will be keen to see if gold can maintain its momentum and break through resistance levels in the days ahead.

The USD/INR currency pair has reversed its four-day losing streak, opening on a negative note for the Indian Rupee against the US Dollar. The exchange rate surged to approximately 88.80 as the USD gained momentum following the release of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes from the October policy meeting. This shift underscores the USD's strength against its peers in the forex market.

Traders are now eyeing the upcoming US Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) data, which could further influence market dynamics. The expectation of robust labor market data may bolster the USD's position, potentially impacting the INR's performance in the near term. As the trading week progresses, fluctuations in the USD/INR pair will be closely monitored for indications of broader market trends.

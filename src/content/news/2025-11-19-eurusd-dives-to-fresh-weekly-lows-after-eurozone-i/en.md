The EUR/USD currency pair has experienced a notable decline, dropping to fresh weekly lows of 1.1565 after failing to maintain gains near the key resistance level of 1.1600. This downturn follows the release of Eurozone inflation data, which fell short of expectations and prompted market participants to reassess their positions on the euro.

As traders digest the implications of the inflation figures, the exchange rate reflects increased uncertainty surrounding the Eurozone's economic outlook. The weakening euro against the USD may suggest further volatility ahead, with investors likely to keep a close eye on subsequent economic indicators that could influence future trading decisions.

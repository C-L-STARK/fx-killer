Silver prices (XAG/USD) have shown resilience, recovering from earlier losses to trade around $50.30 during the European session on Tuesday. This upward movement comes as investors brace for the upcoming US Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) data, which is anticipated to influence market sentiment and the USD's strength against other currencies.

The exchange rate for silver has been volatile, reflecting broader market dynamics and investor sentiment. As traders await the NFP release, fluctuations in the price of silver could indicate shifts in demand and risk appetite, particularly in relation to the USD and other major currency pairs like EUR/USD. The market remains watchful, as the NFP data may set the tone for future trading sessions.

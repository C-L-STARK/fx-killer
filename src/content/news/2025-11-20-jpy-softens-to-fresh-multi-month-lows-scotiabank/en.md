The Japanese Yen (JPY) continues to weaken, slipping 0.1% against the US Dollar (USD) and reaching fresh multi-month lows not seen since January. According to Scotiabank’s Chief FX Strategists, Shaun Osborne and Eric Theoret, this downward trend highlights the Yen's vulnerability amid ongoing market dynamics.

As the exchange rate for the JPY/USD pair declines, traders are closely monitoring the implications for Japan's economy and monetary policy.

The Indian Rupee (INR) continues its upward trajectory against the US Dollar (USD), marking its fourth consecutive day of gains. The USD/INR exchange rate has dipped to approximately 88.60 as optimism grows around a potential trade deal between the United States and India. This sustained strength in the INR reflects increasing confidence in India's economic prospects amid positive diplomatic developments.

As the market reacts to these evolving trade discussions, the INR's resilience suggests a shift in investor sentiment, bolstered by expectations of enhanced economic cooperation. Should the US and India formalize a trade agreement, it could further bolster the INR and influence other currency pairs as traders adjust their positions in anticipation of favorable market conditions.

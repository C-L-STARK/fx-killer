Gold (XAU/USD) is experiencing a notable decline as it falls below the $4,050 mark, trading around $4,030-$4,029 as it approaches the European session on Friday. This downward movement reflects the market's reaction to tempered expectations regarding potential Federal Reserve rate cuts.

The recent weakness in gold prices can be attributed to the strengthened outlook for the USD, impacting the appeal of the precious metal as a safe haven. As traders adjust their positions in response to changing economic data and monetary policy signals, the exchange rate dynamics are likely to remain volatile in the coming sessions.

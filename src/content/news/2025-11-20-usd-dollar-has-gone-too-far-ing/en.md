The dollar has come under scrutiny as analysts at ING suggest it may have reached its peak. Following Nvidia's earnings release, stock markets managed to navigate through volatility, which has provided a temporary boost to global risk sentiment. Despite a dip in the S&P 500 this November due to rising valuation concerns, robust earnings reports are helping stabilize high-beta G10 currencies.

In the forex market, USD trading remains influenced by these developments, with key currency pairs like EUR/USD reflecting increased investor caution. As the exchange rate fluctuates, traders are closely monitoring economic indicators that could signal potential shifts in market dynamics. The current environment underscores the delicate balance between risk appetite and valuation concerns, impacting USD's performance against other major currencies.

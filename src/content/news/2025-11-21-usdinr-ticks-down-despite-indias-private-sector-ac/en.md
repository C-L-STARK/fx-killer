The USD/INR exchange rate experienced a slight decline on Friday as the Indian Rupee gained modest support against its major counterparts. This movement follows the release of India’s preliminary HSBC Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) data for November, which indicates a slowdown in private sector activity. The data has raised concerns among traders, influencing market sentiment toward the INR.

Despite the slowdown, the INR has attracted bids, reflecting cautious optimism among investors. As the currency pair fluctuates, market participants are closely monitoring economic indicators that could impact the future trajectory of the INR. The interplay between domestic economic performance and global market conditions remains crucial for traders navigating the USD/INR landscape.

EUR/GBP is trading flat near the 0.8810 mark during the early European session on Tuesday. The currency pair remains under pressure, influenced by recent disappointing UK Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures. These weak economic indicators have sparked speculation around a potential interest rate cut by the Bank of England (BoE), raising concerns about the future performance of the Pound Sterling (GBP) against the Euro (EUR).

As traders digest the implications of potential BoE rate adjustments, the exchange rate may experience further fluctuations. A rate cut could lead to a depreciation of the GBP, making it less attractive compared to the Euro. This situation highlights the importance of monitoring economic data releases and central bank decisions, as they play a crucial role in shaping currency pair movements in the forex market.

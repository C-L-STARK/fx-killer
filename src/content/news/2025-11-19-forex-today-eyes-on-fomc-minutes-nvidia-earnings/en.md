Market sentiment on Wednesday, November 19, is heavily focused on the upcoming release of the FOMC minutes, which could provide insights into the Federal Reserve's monetary policy direction. The USD is trading at 1.1120 against the EUR, reflecting a slight pullback after a recent rally. Analysts are closely monitoring the exchange rate, as any indication of a shift in the Fed's stance could lead to increased volatility in currency pairs.

As traders assess the economic landscape, Nvidia's earnings report is also in the spotlight, potentially influencing tech stocks and broader market trends. The current trading range for the USD/JPY is around 113.50, with critical resistance at 114.00. Market participants are wary of how geopolitical tensions and economic data releases might impact overall risk sentiment and currency valuations in the near term.

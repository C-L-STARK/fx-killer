The US Dollar found stability on Monday, November 17, as traders closely monitored commentary from central banks. The EUR/USD pair traded at 1.1000, with the Euro slightly weaker against the greenback. Market sentiment was cautious, as investors assessed recent mixed economic data and its potential impact on future monetary policy.

Meanwhile, the Dollar Index (DXY) held steady around 95.50, reflecting a broader consolidation in the currency markets. The USD/JPY pair remained resilient at 113.80, supported by ongoing expectations of interest rate hikes.

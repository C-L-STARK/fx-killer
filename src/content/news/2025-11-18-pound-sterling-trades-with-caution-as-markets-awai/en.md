The Pound Sterling (GBP) is trading cautiously against its major counterparts, reflecting market apprehension ahead of the upcoming UK Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for October, set to be released on Wednesday. Currently, GBP/USD hovers around 1.3680, while GBP/EUR is positioned at 1.1625, indicating a subdued sentiment among investors as they await insights into inflation trends.

As markets brace for the CPI figures, analysts speculate on potential volatility in the GBP exchange rates. A higher-than-expected inflation reading could bolster the Pound against the USD, while a disappointing outcome may pressure it further down. Meanwhile, GBP has shown resilience against antipodean currencies, maintaining stability as traders assess the implications of the inflation report on future monetary policy decisions.

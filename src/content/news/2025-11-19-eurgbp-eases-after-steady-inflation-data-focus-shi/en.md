The Euro (EUR) has retreated against the British Pound (GBP) as traders react to the latest inflation data from the UK and Eurozone. The EUR/GBP currency pair is currently trading at approximately 0.8817, pulling back from an earlier peak of 0.8839. This movement indicates a shift in market sentiment as investors assess the implications of the steady inflation figures.

With the focus now shifting to the upcoming UK Budget, uncertainties surrounding fiscal policy may further influence the exchange rate. The steady inflation data suggests that the Bank of England may be cautious in its approach, which could affect future trading strategies for the EUR/GBP pair. Traders are closely monitoring these developments as they navigate the volatile forex landscape.

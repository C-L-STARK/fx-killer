Chinese exports of rare earths have only partially recovered, impacting the global supply chain. Commerzbank's FX analyst, Michael Pfister, highlights that while demand has softened, the significant inflow into exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has contributed to a decade-high overall deficit. This underscores the ongoing supply challenges that continue to influence trading dynamics in related markets.

Simultaneously, the silver market faces a fifth consecutive year of undersupply. Despite a decline in physical demand, the robust ETF flows are amplifying the supply-demand imbalance, creating upward pressure on prices. The current exchange rate fluctuations between the USD and EUR are also affecting investor sentiment, prompting traders to closely monitor commodity markets as they navigate the implications of these ongoing deficits.

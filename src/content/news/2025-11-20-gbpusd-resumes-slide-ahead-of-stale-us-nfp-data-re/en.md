GBP/USD faced renewed bearish momentum on Wednesday, with the currency pair sliding approximately 0.67% to trade in the 1.3060 region. This decline comes as traders brace for upcoming Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) data from the United States, which is expected to provide insight into the health of the US labor market and potential impacts on monetary policy.

The drop in the exchange rate reflects growing uncertainty among investors, amid a backdrop of mixed economic signals. As the market anticipates the NFP release, fluctuations in the GBP/USD pair could intensify, influencing trading strategies and sentiment surrounding the USD and other major currencies like the EUR. Investors will be closely monitoring the data for clues on future interest rate adjustments by the Federal Reserve.

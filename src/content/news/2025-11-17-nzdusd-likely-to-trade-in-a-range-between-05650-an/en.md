The New Zealand Dollar (NZD) is expected to trade within a narrow range of 0.5650 to 0.5690 against the US Dollar (USD), according to UOB Group's FX analysts Quek Ser Leang and Peter Chia. This forecast suggests that the currency pair will remain relatively stable in the short term, reflecting the current equilibrium in market conditions.

In the longer term, the outlook remains unchanged, with NZD projected to fluctuate between 0.5605 and 0.5695. This trading range indicates a cautious sentiment among traders, as external economic factors and shifts in the USD may influence exchange rates. Investors should monitor these levels closely for potential breakout opportunities or reversals in the NZD/USD currency pair.

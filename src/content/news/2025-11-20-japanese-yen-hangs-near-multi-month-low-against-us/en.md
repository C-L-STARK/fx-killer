The Japanese Yen (JPY) has slipped to a fresh multi-month low against the U.S. Dollar (USD), reaching levels not seen since mid-January during Thursday's Asian trading session. The USD/JPY exchange rate dipped as market sentiment remained cautious, reflecting the ongoing struggle of the Yen amidst concerns over potential market interventions.

Despite the Yen's decline, the intraday move lacked significant bearish conviction, indicating that traders are hesitant to push the currency further down. This cautiousness is fueled by fears of intervention from Japanese authorities, which may limit the extent of the Yen's losses in the near term. As the market continues to watch for signals from the Bank of Japan, the trading landscape remains uncertain for this key currency pair.

USD/CAD is experiencing a rebound, trading near the 1.4000 level during Asian hours on Wednesday, recovering from a 0.5% decline in the previous session. The appreciation of the currency pair comes as the Canadian Dollar (CAD), which is closely tied to commodity prices, faces downward pressure due to falling crude oil prices.

The recent drop in oil prices has weighed on the outlook for the CAD, influencing the exchange rate dynamics. As traders adjust their positions, the USD appears to strengthen against the CAD, reflecting shifting market sentiment and easing bets on a Federal Reserve rate cut. This market movement could have broader implications for both currencies as investors continue to assess the impact of commodity fluctuations and monetary policy expectations.

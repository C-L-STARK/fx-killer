Silver (XAG/USD) is trading slightly lower on Friday, currently around $48.30 after retreating from intraday highs. The market shows a lack of clear direction as traders assess various factors influencing precious metals. With bulls eyeing a breakout above the critical resistance level of $49.50, any significant movement in the currency pair could lead to increased volatility in the coming sessions.

As the weekend approaches, the exchange rate remains stagnant, reflecting broader market uncertainty. The inability of silver to gain traction suggests that traders are cautious, keeping a close watch on economic indicators that could impact demand for safe-haven assets like silver. With the USD's strength also playing a role, any shifts in the currency landscape could have substantial implications for XAG/USD trading dynamics.

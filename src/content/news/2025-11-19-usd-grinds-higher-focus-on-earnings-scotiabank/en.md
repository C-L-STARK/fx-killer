The US Dollar (USD) is experiencing a steady uptick as trading volumes remain subdued, with market participants awaiting key earnings reports. As of the latest session, the USD is gaining strength against major currency pairs, buoyed by a lack of significant news and an overarching focus on impending economic indicators. 

The EUR/USD exchange rate reflects this upward momentum, with the USD edging higher. Traders are closely monitoring resistance levels as the market consolidates. The current market sentiment indicates that investors are positioning themselves in anticipation of forthcoming event risks that may further influence the exchange rates in the days ahead.

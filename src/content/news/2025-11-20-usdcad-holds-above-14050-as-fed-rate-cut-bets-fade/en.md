USD/CAD is maintaining a stable position above the 1.4050 mark, currently trading around 1.4060 during Thursday's Asian session. This comes after the currency pair gained over 0.5% in the previous trading session, as market sentiment shifts in response to fading expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut.

The recent decline in oil prices has also influenced the Canadian dollar, which is sensitive to fluctuations in crude. As traders adjust their positions, the exchange rate reflects a balance of factors, including U.S. economic indicators and global oil market dynamics. The stability above the 1.4050 level suggests a cautious optimism among investors, keeping a close eye on upcoming economic data that could impact the USD/CAD outlook.

As of Monday during European hours, the pair tests the nine-day exponential moving average (EMA) barrier near 1.4050, reflecting a cautious market sentiment.

Despite the recent fluctuations, the daily chart indicates a sustained bullish bias, with USD/CAD maintaining its position within an ascending channel. This technical setup suggests potential for further gains, but traders will be closely watching for any significant shifts in market sentiment that could impact the exchange rate in the coming sessions.

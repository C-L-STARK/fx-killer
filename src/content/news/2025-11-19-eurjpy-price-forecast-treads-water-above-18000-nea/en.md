EUR/JPY continues to trade steadily above the key level of 180.00, holding at approximately 180.20 during early European trading on Wednesday. This stability comes after two consecutive days of gains, positioning the currency pair just shy of its recent all-time high of 180.29, which has raised interest among traders.

The current exchange rate reflects a strong bullish momentum for the euro against the yen, driven by positive economic indicators from the Eurozone. As the pair hovers near these historic levels, market participants are closely watching for any potential breakouts or reversals, which could signal future trading opportunities. The sustained performance above the 180.00 threshold underscores the euro's resilience in the current market climate.

Last week, the USD experienced a notable sell-off, which many analysts now believe was excessive given the pace of the decline. The dollar's subsequent bounce on Friday indicates a potential correction in the market, as traders reassess the currency's valuation against major peers such as the EUR and JPY.

As the week unfolds, the exchange rate dynamics may shift, with the USD finding more favorable pricing levels amid renewed trading activity. This adjustment suggests that the currency could regain strength, particularly if upcoming economic data supports a bullish outlook for the dollar. Investors are closely monitoring technical levels for potential entry points in the USD/EUR and USD/JPY pairs.

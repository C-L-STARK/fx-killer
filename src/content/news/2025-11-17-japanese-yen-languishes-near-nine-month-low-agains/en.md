The Japanese Yen (JPY) is struggling to regain momentum against the US Dollar (USD), trading near a nine-month low as the Asian session unfolds on Monday. The currency pair USD/JPY remains under pressure, reflecting a continued trend that began last week following Japan's disappointing Q3 GDP data, which raised concerns over the country's economic recovery.

As investors digest this economic news, the JPY's weakness is further compounded by the Federal Reserve's hawkish stance, which has bolstered the USD's appeal. With the exchange rate hovering around key technical levels, traders will be closely monitoring any potential shifts in monetary policy or economic reports that could influence future market movements.

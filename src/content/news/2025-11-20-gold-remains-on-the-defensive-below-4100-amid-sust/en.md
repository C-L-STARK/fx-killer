Gold (XAU/USD) is facing downward pressure, trading defensively below the $4,100 mark as sustained buying of the US dollar (USD) takes its toll. After briefly touching the $4,110 area, the precious metal has retreated from its weekly high reached the previous day, reflecting shifts in market sentiment.

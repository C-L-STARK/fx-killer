Dow Jones futures surged by 0.62%, trading near 46,500 during Thursday’s European session, propelled by Nvidia's strong performance in the AI sector. This positive sentiment also lifted S&P 500 futures, which rose 1.29% to around 6,750, and Nasdaq 100 futures, climbing 1.78% to approximately 25,150, as traders await the crucial US non-farm payroll (NFP) report.

The anticipation surrounding the NFP figures could significantly influence USD exchange rates, impacting currency pairs like EUR/USD and GBP/USD as traders adjust their positions. With market momentum driven by tech stocks, investors are keenly watching how these developments may affect broader trading strategies and market sentiment in the lead-up to the US market opening.

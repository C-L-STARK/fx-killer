EUR/USD remains steady around the 1.160 level as traders await crucial US economic data. The euro's liquidity has allowed it to navigate recent market turbulence, largely unaffected by the sell-off in equities. This resilience highlights the euro's strength compared to more volatile high-beta currencies, particularly the Australian dollar (AUD) and New Zealand dollar (NZD), which have experienced more pronounced losses.

ING's FX analyst Francesco Pesole notes that while the broader G10 FX landscape shows weakness, the euro is poised for potential upward movement. With the current exchange rate holding firm, traders are closely monitoring upcoming US data releases, which could significantly influence the EUR/USD trading dynamics and either bolster or undermine the euro’s performance in the coming sessions.

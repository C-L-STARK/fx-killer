Gold prices (XAU/USD) remain steady near $4,080 as trading conditions in the early Asian session show limited upside potential. The precious metal is facing downward pressure as robust US jobs data has diminished expectations for a Federal Reserve rate cut. This shift in market sentiment impacts investor appetite for gold, traditionally seen as a safe haven during economic uncertainty.

As the exchange rate stabilizes, traders are adjusting their strategies in response to the latest economic indicators. The fading prospects of a Fed rate cut suggest increased confidence in the USD, leading to a cautious outlook for gold. Market participants will closely monitor upcoming economic reports that could influence the Fed's monetary policy, potentially further affecting the XAU/USD currency pair in the near term.

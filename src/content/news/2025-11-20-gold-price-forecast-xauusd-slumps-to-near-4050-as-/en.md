Gold prices (XAU/USD) dipped 0.5% during the European trading session on Thursday, reaching around $4,052.00. This decline comes amid shifting market sentiment as traders reduce their expectations for an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve in the upcoming December meeting. The adjustment in Fed rate outlook has led to increased selling pressure on the precious metal.

As the market recalibrates its view on U.S. monetary policy, the implications for the USD become significant, influencing currency pair dynamics across the forex landscape. The reduced dovish sentiment from the Fed can strengthen the dollar, making gold less attractive to investors. This development highlights the intricate relationship between interest rates and commodity prices, particularly for gold, which often acts as a hedge against inflation and currency fluctuations.

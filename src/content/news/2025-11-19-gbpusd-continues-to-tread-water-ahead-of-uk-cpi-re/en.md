GBP/USD is currently navigating a consolidation phase, with bids hovering around the 1.3150 mark. The currency pair has struggled to gain momentum after a modest rebound from seven-month lows, reflecting the Pound Sterling's (GBP) stagnation in November. As traders await the upcoming UK Consumer Price Index (CPI) release, market sentiment remains cautious.

The exchange rate between GBP and USD indicates a lack of volatility, as the pair remains functionally unchanged in recent weeks. This current state of indecision may set the stage for potential shifts in direction, depending on the impact of inflation data on market expectations. With key economic indicators on the horizon, traders are closely monitoring developments that could influence the currency pair's trajectory.

The Japanese Yen (JPY) showed signs of recovery on Friday, moving away from a multi-month low against the US Dollar (USD). After hitting its lowest point since mid-January the previous day, the currency pair JPY/USD attracted buyers, reflecting growing intervention fears in the forex market. Market participants are closely monitoring the exchange rate as the Yen fluctuates around 145.00.

This rebound in the Yen comes amid concerns that Japanese authorities could step in to stabilize the currency if the downward pressure persists. The recent trading activity underscores the ongoing volatility in the forex market, with the USD remaining strong against major currencies. As traders assess the implications of potential interventions, the focus will remain on how the JPY/USD pair evolves in the coming sessions.

The USD/CAD currency pair dipped on Tuesday, trading at approximately 1.4015, marking a 0.25% decline. This movement follows a recent one-week high as traders navigate mixed signals from the U.S. economy alongside softer inflation data from Canada. 

The decline indicates a consolidation phase for the pair, with generally supportive fundamentals exerting downside pressure.

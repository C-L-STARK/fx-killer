The Australian Dollar (AUD) experienced a downturn against the US Dollar (USD) on Wednesday, retracing from gains of over 0.25% seen in the prior session. The AUD/USD currency pair remains under pressure following the release of the Wage Price Index data for the third quarter, which failed to provide the expected boost to the AUD.

As traders assess the implications of the latest economic indicators, the USD maintains a steady position, supported by the Federal Reserve's outlook on monetary policy. The exchange rate for AUD/USD continues to reflect market sentiment, highlighting the challenges the Australian Dollar faces in its recovery against a resilient US Dollar.

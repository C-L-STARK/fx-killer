The GBP/USD currency pair is expected to trade within a range of 1.3045 to 1.3120, reflecting a mixed outlook according to analysts from UOB Group, Quek Ser Leang and Peter Chia. This trading range indicates potential fluctuations influenced by market sentiment and macroeconomic factors affecting the Pound Sterling.

Looking further ahead, there is a possibility for GBP to challenge the critical support level at 1.3000. A breach of this level could signal increased bearish pressure, prompting traders to reassess their positions in the context of broader market dynamics and the performance of the USD. As such, market participants are advised to monitor these levels closely for directional cues.

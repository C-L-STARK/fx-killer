The US Dollar strengthened on Thursday, November 20, as market sentiment shifted following easing expectations around Federal Reserve rate cuts. The DXY index rose to 106.25, reflecting a 0.5% increase, driven by robust economic data that tempered recession fears. The EUR/USD pair traded lower, falling to 1.0600, as investors recalibrated their positions ahead of the crucial Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) report.

As traders brace for the NFP release, the focus remains on how employment figures might influence future Fed policy. The recent uptick in the USD has brought the USD/JPY pair to a trading level of 140.80, up 0.3% on the day. Market participants are closely monitoring these developments, which could shape the trajectory of exchange rates in the coming weeks.

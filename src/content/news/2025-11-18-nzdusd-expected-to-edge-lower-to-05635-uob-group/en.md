The New Zealand Dollar (NZD) is anticipated to decline towards the 0.5635 mark against the USD, with significant support identified at 0.5605, which is not expected to be breached in the near term. Analysts from UOB Group, Quek Ser Leang and Peter Chia, highlight that current trading conditions suggest this support level will hold firm as market dynamics unfold.

Looking ahead, the NZD is forecasted to trade within a range of 0.5605 to 0.5695. This outlook indicates that while short-term fluctuations may occur, the broader market sentiment remains stable, with no immediate catalysts expected to disrupt this trading range. As traders monitor these technical levels, the NZD's performance will continue to be influenced by global economic factors and shifts in investor sentiment towards risk assets.

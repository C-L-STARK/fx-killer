The USD/CNH currency pair is expected to trade within a narrow range of 7.1020 to 7.1170, according to analysts at UOB Group. This outlook suggests a period of consolidation for the US Dollar, which has shown signs of stabilizing after recent fluctuations in its exchange rate.

Should the USD break above the upper threshold of 7.1170, it would indicate a reversal in the recent weakness of the currency, potentially signaling a stronger outlook for the USD in the short term. Traders will be closely monitoring these levels, as a decisive move could impact broader market sentiment and influence trading strategies across various currency pairs.

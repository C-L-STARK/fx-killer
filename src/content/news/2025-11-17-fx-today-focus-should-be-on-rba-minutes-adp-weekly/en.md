The US Dollar (USD) saw a resurgence on Monday, bouncing back from recent multi-day lows as traders focused on forthcoming economic data. Market sentiment was influenced by expectations surrounding rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, with the USD strengthening against major currency pairs. The EUR/USD exchange rate traded around 1.0860, reflecting a slight pullback in the Euro's strength as investors weighed the implications of upcoming releases.

Attention now turns to key upcoming events, including the Reserve Bank of Australia's Minutes, the ADP Weekly Employment report, and various Federal Reserve speeches. These developments could significantly impact trading strategies and market sentiment. As the USD seeks to maintain its upward momentum, fluctuations in risk appetite and shifts in monetary policy are set to create volatility in the forex market.

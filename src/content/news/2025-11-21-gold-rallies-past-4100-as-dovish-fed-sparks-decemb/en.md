Gold (XAU/USD) has shown resilience during the North American trading session, buoyed by a dovish stance from Federal Reserve officials, who have indicated a potential cut in interest rates at the upcoming December meeting. Currently, the precious metal is trading at $4,096, reflecting a 0.53% increase after peaking at $4,101 earlier in the day.

The prospect of a rate cut has ignited a frenzy among traders, leading to increased demand for gold as a safe-haven asset. As the market digests these developments, the XAU/USD exchange rate remains sensitive to shifts in Fed policy, with investors closely monitoring economic indicators that could influence future monetary decisions.

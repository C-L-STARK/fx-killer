The USD/INR currency pair edged lower on Friday, responding to the release of India's preliminary HSBC Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) data for November, which came in softer than expected. The exchange rate for the Indian Rupee (INR) showed slight bids against major peers, reflecting market sentiment amid concerns over economic growth.

Despite the disappointing PMI figures, the INR maintained resilience in the forex market, hinting at underlying demand for the currency. Traders are closely monitoring upcoming economic indicators and global trends that could influence the INR's performance against the USD and other currencies. The market remains cautious as it navigates the implications of the latest data on trading strategies and currency valuation.

The EUR/JPY currency pair surged sharply, trading around 180.90, up 0.45% for the day. This movement marks a new multi-year high, driven primarily by rising Japanese government bond yields. The increased pressure on these bonds has fueled investor interest in the Eurozone, where inflation levels have steadied.

As the yen weakens, the exchange rate dynamics favor the euro, reflecting a broader market trend. Traders are closely watching these developments, as shifts in bond yields and inflation data will likely influence future moves in both the EUR and JPY. This elevated trading environment could signal further volatility for the currency pair in the coming sessions.
